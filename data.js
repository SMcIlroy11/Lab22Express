var lyrics = ["With your hand on my shoulders, a meaningless movement...a moviescript ending",
"I wish we could open our eyes/To see in all directions at the same time/Oh what a beautiful view/ If you were never aware of what was around you.", "And it's hard to want to stay awake/When everyone you meet, they all seem to be asleep/And you wonder if you're missing a dream.", "No you can't find nothing at all, if there was nothing there all along.", "And when my mirror speaks it never minces words/'Cause these eyes don't shine half as bright/As they used to do and they haven't for quite a while.", "Was I in your way, when the cameras turned to face you? No room in frame for two."];
