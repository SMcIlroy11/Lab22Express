var lyrics = ["With your hand on my shoulders, a meaningless movement...a moviescript ending",
"I wish we could open our eyes/To see in all directions at the same time/Oh what a beautiful view/If you were never aware of what was around you.", "And it's hard to want to stay awake/When everyone you meet, they all seem to be asleep/And your wonder if you're missing a dream."]
