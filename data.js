var lyrics = ["With your hand on my shoulders, a meaningless movement...a moviescript ending",
"I wish we could open our eyes...To see in all directions at the same time...Oh what a beautiful view... If you were never aware of what was around you.", "And it's hard to want to stay awake...When everyone you meet, they all seem to be asleep...And you wonder if you're missing a dream.", "No you can't find nothing at all, if there was nothing there all along.", "And when my mirror speaks it never minces words...'Cause these eyes don't shine half as bright...As they used to do and they haven't for quite a while.", "Was I in your way, when the cameras turned to face you? No room in frame for two.", "You gotta spend some time, Love. You gotta spend some time with me. And I know that you'll find, love I will possess your heart. I will possess your heart.", "Our youth is fleeting...Old age is just around the bend...And i can't wait to go grey...And i'll sit and wonder...Of every love that could've been...If i'd only thought of something charming to say."];
